  <h1>Mountain Biking</h1>
    <p>Mountain biking is a sport that involves riding a bike on offroad trails. The trails can vary from something as basic as a flat dirt path to a steep, narrow trail covered with rocks and roots. </p>
  <h2>2 Types of Bikes</h2>
    <p>There are 2 main bike designs: full suspension or hardtail. A hardtail has suspension for the front wheel only while a full suspension bike has suspension elements for the front and rear wheels.</p>

        <td>Cross country (or XC) bikes are designed for maximum efficency on flat ground and climbs. They can be full suspension or hardtails. Suspension travel ranges from 80-110mm.

        <td>All mountain bikes are designed to climb decently well but also be fun on technical and fast downhill sections. They aren't as efficient as XC bikes and aren't as capable in rough and steep terrain as downhill bikes, but strike a balance between the two. These bikes are almost always full suspension and have 120-170mm of suspension travel.

        <td>Downhill (or DH) bikes are meant for all out speed and capability on steep, technical, downhill sections of trail. They are virtually impossible to ride uphill and are extremely innefficient when riding on flat, tame trails. Their suspension travel ranges from 180-210mm.
